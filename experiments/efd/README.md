## This directory holds experimental notebooks demonstrating interaction with the `efd`.

Note that these notebooks will only work if the environment processing the notebook can see the `efd` endpoint.

Currently, the only `efd` receiving live telemetry is located in the lab at NOAO and is only visible to the NOAO network.
This means that notebooks run on either nublado or the LDF will not work.

Finally, you will need the credentials for the `efd` server.
Ask your local `SAL` expert if you don't know them.
