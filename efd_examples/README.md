## This directory holds example notebooks demonstrating interaction with the `efd`.

These notebooks are intended to work when executed from the LSP running at the LDF.
Currently they access the `efd` running on the `int` cluster, but will move eventually to access the `stable` version.

You will need the credentials for the `efd` server.
We intend to put in place read only credentials automatically.
Until that happens, ask your local `SAL` expert if you don't know them.
